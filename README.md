### NMR pipeline
A simple pipeline to train models on [Numerai](https://numer.ai/leaderboard) data.

### To Run
This pipeline uses a Jupyter notebook as its interface. Clone this repository and start the notebook server. Use the **nmr** notebook to configure, train, and evaluate your sklearn model (I'll do my best to add support for other frameworks). The **nmr_explorer** notebook can be used to visualize the data and perform some  basic EDA.
